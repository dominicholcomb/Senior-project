# Senior project

My senior project for my statistics major.

An investigation of the relationship between religious belief and social views in the US.

30-page report including a classification/logistic model build, data visualization, and analysis.

Pages 2-8 is mostly text describing relevant context (statistical & theological) of the research.

Pages 9-29 include (13) figures/visualizations, if you are interested in skimming.
